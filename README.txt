Confine Me is an Android Application that is designed to evaluate the security of the device it runs on, giving an estimate on the security vulnerability of the device.

It has three buttons on the home screen: Overall System Scan, Vulnerability Scan, System Scan. The overall system scan, as the name suggests, is the "parent" in the hierarchical design of the system, performing all the system evaluations covered in both the Vulnerability Scan and System Scan.
 
It also gives recommendations to the user based on the evaluations performed to tweak the settings, in order to help enhance the security of the device as much as possible.
